ghar (ghar: home as repositories)
Brandon Philips <brandon@ifup.org>

ghar can help you manage your $HOME in git using a collection of git
repos seperated by topic or privacy. For example if you work on a
variety of machines and want to share your .emacs on github but not your
.ssh then ghar is for you.

INSTALL
=======
  $ git clone git://ifup.org/philips/ghar.git
  $ export PATH=$PATH:`pwd`/ghar/bin/ # You may wish to make this permanent

Getting Started
===============
  $ cd ghar	# cd into the clone of ghar you made above
  $ ls
  bin COPYING README
  $ mkdir devel
  $ cd devel
  $ git init
  $ mv ~/.vimrc .
  $ git add .vimrc
  $ git commit -m "vimrc: initial commit"
  $ ghar install
    devel
      installed	/home/philips/.vimrc
  $ ghar install --status
    devel
     ok	/home/philips/.vimrc

Adding External Repos
=====================
  # While in the base of the ghar directory
  $ ghar add git://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh.git oh-my-zsh
  $ ghar install
    oh-my-zsh
     installed	/home/philips/.oh-my-zsh

Upgrading a machine
===================
To upgrade a machine to the latest version of all of the repos do the
following:

  $ ghar pull		# pull in all repos
  $ ghar install	# install any new files

DONE! Enjoy the latest version of your configs.

Thanks

These two chaps helped me on the original bash implementation. However,
our original plan of attack ended up being too unwieldy as it used the
--git-dir directive to do the magic instead of symlinks.
