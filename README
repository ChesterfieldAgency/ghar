ghar (ghar: home as repositories)
Brandon Philips <brandon@ifup.org>

ghar can help you manage your $HOME in git using a collection of git
repos seperated by topic or privacy. For example if you work on a
variety of machines and want to share your .emacs on github but not your
.ssh then ghar is for you.

INSTALL
=======
  $ git clone git://ifup.org/philips/ghar.git
  $ export PATH=$PATH:`pwd`/ghar/bin/ # You may wish to make this permanent

Getting Started
===============
  $ cd ghar
  $ mkdir devel
  $ cd devel
  $ git init
  $ mv ~/.vimrc .
  $ git add .vimrc
  $ git commit -m "vimrc: initial commit"
  $ ghar install
    devel
      installed	/home/philips/.vimrc
  $ ghar install --status
    devel
     ok	/home/philips/.vimrc

Adding External Repos
=====================
  # While in the base of the ghar directory
  $ ghar add git://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh.git oh-my-zsh
  $ ghar install
    oh-my-zsh
     installed	/home/philips/.oh-my-zsh

Thanks
======
These two chaps helped me on the original bash implementation. However,
our original plan of attack ended up being too unwieldy as it used the
--git-dir directive to do the magic instead of symlinks.
